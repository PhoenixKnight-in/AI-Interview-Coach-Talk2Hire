 To handle the delay, I'd start by reviewing the project timeline and identifying which milestones are at risk. Next, I'd consult with the remaining team members to redistribute the workload. If needed, I'd adjust the deadlines or escalate the issue to management for support. Throughout, I would keep all the stakeholders informed.
